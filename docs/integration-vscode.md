## Introduction

The Codiga VS Code plugin lets you integrate the Codiga
analysis engine directly in VS Code. No need to install multiple tools
or wait the pull requests: all analysis results come directly in your
development environment.

## Quick Start

The Codiga plugin is available on the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codiga.vscode-plugin).

You can find it directly within VS Code, as shown below.

## Linking your Codiga Account (optional).

Linking your Codiga account lets you import your project preferences for the code analysis.

You need to have an account on [Codiga](https://www.codiga.io) and have your project
inspected by Codiga. Once done, get your API tokens on Codiga on
[your tokens page](https://app.codiga.io/api-tokens).

You can check that the API connection is working using the command `Codiga: Test API connection` (⇧⌘P).
