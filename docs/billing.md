Codiga has two billing methods depending on the type of users or groups:

- **GitHub** users can pay through the GitHub marketplace or directly on our platform through our Stripe integration
- **GitLab** and **Bitbucket** can only pay through our platform and our Stripe integration.

**Important note**: regardless of the payment platform, Codiga **never** stores your financial information.

## Stripe Integration

Our Stripe integration is the most flexible option for you and us. You can
start, update your subscription at any time for all types of accounts.

- **Pros**: supports free-trial, promotion code and gives us the possibility to issue refunds and discounts
- **Cons**: not integrated with GitHub (if you are a GitHub users)

### Billing Cycle

You are billed monthly for the service through your credit card.

### Changing your credit card

Update the credit card in the user or group that has the active subscription.

### Canceling your membership

To cancel the membership, change the membership of the user or group
to the basic level. It will automatically cancel the membership.

## GitHub marketplace

GitHub users that choose to be billed through the GitHub marketplace
need to manage their subscription through the [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/code-inspector).

The advantage of using the GitHub marketplace is to be billed directly
through GitHub. However, we have less control of this payment platform
and cannot issue promotion code or refunds if necessary.

- **Pros**: unique billing through GitHub
- **Cons**: no free-trial, no promotion code, discount or refunds.

### Billing Cycle

You are billed monthly for the service through your credit card.

### Changing your credit card

Update the credit card is done directly on GitHub.

### Canceling your membership

To cancel the membership, change your subscription level back to Basic
on the [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/code-inspector).

Your subscription will get back to Basic and GitHub will then stop processing
payment on your card.

## Seats

When taking a membership of groups, you buy seats, that represents
the number of users in your group. You need to buy at least enough
seats for all the users using your group project and repositories.

Seats are being checked by our system periodically. **If you have more users
than seats, you will receive an email to purchase more seats for your team.**
